        I visited the office hours of my computer science professor earlier in the quarter. I believe I attended my professor's office hours during week 2 regarding a complex assignment due the next day. The name of my professor is Toby Gustafson and I remember that, along with needing some assistance with the assignment, I have also been wanting to meet the professor in a one on one environment. The reason why I wanted to meet Professor Toby in a one on one setting is because during Mr. Gustafson lectures, he seems to be a very nice and laid-back person with a great personality. Needing help with an assignment had provided me with a great opportunity to meet Toby as well as to get the help I needed to complete the assignment. In a sense, it was like killing two birds with one stone. In the zoom session during Professor Gustafson's office hours, he and I went over the issues I was having with the assignment. During this time, I was also asking Toby a bunch of questions regarding both the assignment and the class as well as questions to just get to know Professor Gustafson better. The assignment that I needed help with was a lab in the LearnCS8 website. Our assignment was to create our own advertisement website and I needed help with figuring out how to transfer pictures I looked up on google into my website project. Toby showed me how to transfer the pictures and it was very easy and obvious to do. Toby teased me about it and it was funny, it was a good time.

I had also visited the office hours of my math TA earlier in the quarter. I believe I attended the office hours of my TA during week 3 or 4 when she was doing a full review on all the math material we had learned in order to help us get ready for the math midterm. So in other words, I attended my TA's office hours session during the week of the midterms. My TA's name, Alysha, is a second or third year UCR student and she is doing a great job at being a TA. Alysha is very knowledgeable when it comes to math and she knows how to teach complex mathematical concepts in a way that makes it seem easy to the students. As I recall, I believe Alysha's zoom session was the very first session I attended as a UC Riverside student at the very beginning of the fall quarter. The fact that Alysha was the very first instructor I met and interacted with before any of my other instructors definitely helped me transition into college more smoothly. I feel like if I had met any of the other instructors first before Alysha I would not have transitioned as smoothly. The reason is that Alysha was very welcoming and quickly debunked my expectations that college would be a very difficult and stressful experience. I have attended a few of Alysha's office hour sessions but I chose to write about the session where Alysha helped us review for the midterm because it is the most recent office hours I have attended. I didn't ask any questions during the session but I paid attention to all Alysha had to say and I believe I did fairly well on the math midterm as a result.<br><br>
